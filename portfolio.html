                    <p>This was a final project for one of my classes that I took and decided to add more features to it. This was completely written in Python and uses PyGame to display the BlackJack cards and features. The program uses a terminal to display the rules and asks the user what they would like to do. When they initiate to play the game, PyGame displays the game to the user. There are many more exciting changes coming!</p>

                    <p>I created Tetris with Python! This was my take on it as I changed the colors of the blocks to look more aesthetically pleasing for me and hopefully other people. I first created the grid and then created the blocks that we all know as Tetris blocks. The program operates on PyGame and the same rules of Tetris apply to my version. I use arrow keys and the space bar to move the blocks around. It also saves your high score and progresively goes faster as you level up.</p>
